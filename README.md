# Data sets

We currently have two datasets from CJST and EJScreen Info. EJScreen uses 2020 Census tracts (and IDs) while CEJST still uses 2010. 

The raw and processed data are stored in this  [GDrive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DW8KQmTR1pHRw7dMYcizVAe9a-mCl3zr) shared in this folder in zip and it should be uncompressed to use. Since, The data is large unable to use git's [Large File Storage](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-large-files-on-github) is over its data quota.
